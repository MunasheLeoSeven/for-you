      <h2>Hey 🤍</h2>

      <p>
        I wanted you the way that squirrel in Ice Age wanted its acorn
        desperately, hopelessly, comically determined. And yet I ran from you
        like a vampire fleeing the sun, afraid you’d burn me with the warmth I
        secretly craved. I was obsessed, even as I tried to deny every feeling
        rising in me. I wanted to offer you everything, but when I looked at my
        hands, I found nothing.
      </p>

      <p>
        You deserved good things, and I never truly believed I could be one of
        them. I was a damaged soul, still bleeding from old, unhealed wounds.
        And though no one is perfect, I convinced myself that love was something
        I was unworthy of seeking.
      </p>

      <p>
        I fell in love with the concept of knowing you and maybe that sounds
        strange, but there’s so much I don’t know. Only the parts you’ve chosen
        to show me. Still, I want to know more. Not just the surface, but the
        layers beneath the thoughts you hide, the dreams you chase, the quiet
        parts of you that don’t ask to be seen.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think I’m in love with your mystery. And maybe that’s what pulls me
        closer the endless desire to discover you, gently, honestly, without
        fear.
      </p>
