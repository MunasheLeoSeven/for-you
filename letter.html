      <h2>Hey 🤍</h2>

      <p>
        I wanted you the way that squirrel in Ice Age wanted its acorn
        desperately, hopelessly, comically determined.
      </p>

      <p>
        And yet I ran from you like a vampire fleeing the sun, afraid you’d burn
        me with the warmth I craved.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was obsessed, even as I tried to deny every feeling rising in me. I
        wanted to offer you everything, but in my hands I found nothing.
      </p>

      <p>
        You deserved good things, and I never believed I could be one of them. I
        was a damaged soul, still bleeding from old, unhealed wounds.
      </p>

      <p>
        And though no one is perfect, I convinced myself that love was something
        I was unworthy of seeking.
      </p>

      <p>I fell in love with the concept of knowing you.</p>

      <p>
        There’s so much I don’t know — only the parts you’ve chosen to show me.
        But I want to know more.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not just the surface, but the layers beneath, the thoughts you hide, the
        dreams you chase.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think I’m in love with your mystery. And maybe that’s what pulls me
        closer — the endless desire to discover you.
      </p>
